siva_map.py is the mapper code for Part 2 of this preliminary submission

mapper.py is the mapper code for Part 1. I ran it multiple times, changing which function

aboutsull -> Sullivan Tweets
positive -> Positive Sullivan Ratio
anti -> Negative Dragas Ratio
aboutdrag -> Dragas Tweets

For this submission, both parts used the same reducer.py
